	abstract = {We introduce the R-package learnMET, developed as a flexible framework to enable a collection of analyses on multi-environment trial (MET) breeding data with machine learning-based models. learnMET allows the combination of genomic information with environmental data such as climate and/or soil characteristics. Notably, the package offers the possibility of incorporating weather data from field weather stations, or can retrieve global meteorological datasets from a NASA database. Daily weather data can be aggregated over specific periods of time based on naive (for instance, non-overlapping 10-day windows) or phenological approaches. Different machine learning methods for genomic prediction are implemented, including gradient boosted trees, random forests, stacked ensemble models, and multi-layer perceptrons. These prediction models can be evaluated via a collection of cross-validation schemes that mimic typical scenarios encountered by plant breeders working with MET experimental data in a user-friendly way. The package is fully open source and accessible on GitHub.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
