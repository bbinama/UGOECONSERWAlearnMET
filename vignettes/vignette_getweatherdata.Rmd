# Step 1-A: Specifying input data and processing parameters
In this example, we will show how to create a `METData` object when one needs to obtain weather data from external data source. In the package, weather information from the NASA/POWER is extracted and aggregated in day-windows which will be thereafter used (in step 2) as environmental predictor variables.\
The user must provide as input data genotypic and phenotypic data, as well as basic information about the field experiments (e.g. longitude, latitude, planting and harvest date necessary to retrieve weather data from the growing season). These input data are checked and warning messages are given as output if the data are not correctly formatted. \
In this example, we use data from the [Genomes to Fields dataset](https://www.genomes2fields.org/) (@alkhalifah2018maize, @mcfarland2020maize), which is implemented in the package as a toy dataset. For this dataset, soil variables are available **and we will retrieve weather data using the nasapower package** (@sparks2018nasapower) for the 22 environments included in the dataset. (more information on the datasets with `?pheno_G2F`,`?geno_G2F`,`?map_G2F`,`?climate_variables_G2F`,`?info_environments_G2F`, `?soil_G2F`).\
In this case, soil covariates by environment are available and can be used in predictions. These data should be provided as input in `create_METData()` using the argument *soil_variables*. To get weather data from NASA/POWER, one must set the argument  *compute_climatic_ECs* to TRUE.\
Do not forget to indicate where the daily weather data and the plots of clustering analyses should be saved using the argument *path_to_save*.\
The daily weather data will be saved in a subdirectory of this directory that is automatically created and called **weather_data**. \
The method used to build environmental covariates based on daily weather data is the default one: "fixed_nb_windows_across_env", which means that in each environment, the growing season is split into a number of windows equal to nb_windows_intervals (by defaultm this value is equal to 10).
To get more information on the different methods implemented in the package to build climatic environmental
variables based ond daily weather information, please refer to the documentation of the function `get_ECs()`.

```{r}
library(learnMET)

data(geno_G2F)
data(pheno_G2F)
data(map_G2F)
data(info_environments_G2F)
data(soil_G2F)
METdata_G2F <-
  create_METData(
    geno = geno_G2F,
    pheno = pheno_G2F,
    map = map_G2F,
    climate_variables = NULL,
    compute_climatic_ECs = TRUE,
    info_environments = info_environments_G2F,
    soil_variables = soil_G2F,
    path_to_save = '~/learnMET_analyses/G2F'
  )


```


The function `print.summary.METData()` gives an overview of the created MET data object.\
 

```{r}
summary(METdata_G2F)

```

# Step 1-B: Look at the results from the clustering analyses

The `create_METData()` function integrates clustering analyses with the kmeans algorithm (@hartigan1979algorithm) on environmental variables. \
In the directory corresponding to the *path_to_save* argument, a subdirectory called **clustering_analysis** is created, which contains 3 additional subdirectories: **only_weather**, which contains clustering plots based on solely weather-based variables;
**only_soil**, which contains clustering plots based on solely soil variables; and **all_env_data**, which contains clustering plots based on all environmental variables (soil + weather-based).\
All clustering analyses are performed with different K (number of clusters), and corresponding plots are generated for a range of k values. In addition, plots to visualize the total within-cluster sums of squares (elbow method) and the average Silhouette score (@hartigan1979algorithm) - metric obtained with the cluster package (@clusterpackage)) for a range of k values are also saved in the adequate folders. These latter plots can be useful to assess the best number of clusters to consider.\
NOte that for the clustering analyses are run with `nstart = 25` so that the k-means algorithm create multiple initial configurations and outputs the best one.\
For instance, with k = 4,below is the plot of how environments included in this MET dataset cluster, with k = 4: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("climate_variables_only_clusters_environments_4.png", dpi = 150)
```
\
Below is the plot obtained for the elbow method with different k values: one should decide on the number of clusters so that, when adding another cluster, it does not improve much the total intra-cluster variation (that we want to minimize). In this case, 4 seems to be not so bad!\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_elbow_method.png", dpi = 150)
```
\
The Silhouette score is also used to validate results from clustering. It gives a measure of how well observations are clustered with other observations within a cluster. It is calculated for each observation of the dataset, and the final metric corresponds to the average over all observations for a given k. A large average Silhouette score reflects that observations are well clustered with this k number of clusters.\
Here, 5 seems to be a better choice based on the Silhouette score.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_sil_score.png", dpi = 150)
```

# Step 1-C: Computing environmental covariates: different methods possible

In the first chunk of code presented above, daily weather data have been saved in a folder called **weather_data**. We can load these daily weather tables from NASA/POWER, and then implement different methods to build day-windows (using the argument **method_ECs_intervals**) which will represent climate variables for the ML-based prediction models. To re-use the daily weather data obtained via the NASA/POWER query, just specify these with the argument **raw_weather_data** (see example below). These data will be analyzed as\
For instance with "fixed_length_time_windows_across_env" as below, with day-windows computed in each environment
with a width of 8 days: \
**Note: be careful to use a different path so that the clustering analyses results obtained with the different
environmental datasets do not overlap!**

```{r, warning = FALSE}
daily_weather_tables_g2f <- readRDS("daily_weather_tables_nasapower.RDS")

METdata_G2F_2 <-
  create_METData(
    geno = geno_G2F,
    pheno = pheno_G2F,
    map = map_G2F,
    climate_variables = NULL,
    compute_climatic_ECs = TRUE,
    raw_weather_data = daily_weather_tables_g2f,
    method_ECs_intervals = "fixed_length_time_windows_across_env",
    duration_time_window_days = 8,
    info_environments = info_environments_G2F,
    soil_variables = soil_G2F,
    path_to_save = '~/learnMET_analyses/G2F/method_2'
  )
```

```{r}
summary(METdata_G2F_2)

```
If one has information about the phenological stages in each environment (either by observations done from the field, or from results from a crop growth model, for instance Sirius (@jamieson1998sirius) or APSIM (@keating2003overview, @holzworth2014apsim), one can provide a table which
indicates at which day after planting the crop has reached a new developmental stage.
This table should be provided as input via the argument **intervals_growth_manual**, and the method for computing climate variables should now be chosen as "user_defined_intervals".\
The names of each developmental stage can be indicated in the column names, which can be useful after analyses to identify which wether-based covariate had more weight in the machine learning model used.
An example of a table is given as example data in the package (see below). **The example provided is given to illustrate how the user should format the table, but was not created to reflect the true growth stage of the crop in these environments!**\

In this case, each growth period is estimated for **all genotypes tested in this environment**: the package does not incorporate at the moment specificity at the genotype level to take into account genotypic variation regarding plant development and phenology. For more information on this topic, please have a look at the following publications: @heslot2014integrating, @technow2015integrating, @rincent2019using.\

One can also modify the base temperature (using the argument **base_temperature** - see example below) which is used to estimate accumulated GDD in each environment.
The value of the base temperature depends on the crop under study and can be found in the literature.



```{r, warning = FALSE}
data("intervals_growth_manual_G2F")
knitr::kable(head(intervals_growth_manual_G2F))

METdata_G2F_2 <-
  create_METData(
    geno = geno_G2F,
    pheno = pheno_G2F,
    map = map_G2F,
    climate_variables = NULL,
    compute_climatic_ECs = TRUE,
    raw_weather_data = daily_weather_tables_g2f,
    method_ECs_intervals = "user_defined_intervals",
    intervals_growth_manual = intervals_growth_manual_G2F,
    base_temperature = 12,
    info_environments = info_environments_G2F,
    soil_variables = soil_G2F,
    path_to_save = '~/learnMET_analyses/G2F/method_growth_stages'
  )
