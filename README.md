`learnMET` (**learn** **M**ulti-**E**nvironment **T**rials) provides a
pipeline for crop predictive breeding. In particular, `learnMET` (1)
facilitate environmental characterization via the retrieval and
aggregation of daily weather data; (2) allows the evaluation of various
types of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches based on relevant
cross-validation schemes for multi-environment trial datasets (3)
enables to implement predictions for unobserved configurations of
genotypic and environmental predictors that the user wants to test *in
silico*.

As part of the CONSERWA Project (https://conserwa.eu/the-conserwa-case-studies/), we are currently extending the software to integrate additional data on weed interactions and soil microbiomes, thereby enhancing its capacity to predict crop performance in more complex agricultural environments. This includes the parametrization of weed competition and the effect of the microbiome on drought tolerance. This helps breeders choose cultivars that do well in certain conditions.

In the Reference section, the different functions implemented in the
package are listed. **Only the so called main functions have to be run
by the user in a typical workflow**.

# Installation

Install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/cjubin/learnMET) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cjubin/learnMET")

# To build the HTML vignette use
devtools::install_github("cjubin/learnMET", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Package documentation and vignettes

Vignettes and documentation are available at:
<https://cjubin.github.io/learnMET/>  
Vignettes are displayed under the Articles section.

# Publication

A publication is available that describes the main features of the
package and how to apply the different functions as a workflow. Results
are provided for several Machine Learning state-of-the-art models tested
with two breeding datasets:

# Feedback

We are glad about any new user testing learnMET!  
Please contact us if you encounter issues to use some functions of the
package (contact: <cathy.jubin@hotmail.com>).  
Please also do not hesitate to report errors, or additional features
that could be added to the package.
