`learnMET` (**learn** **M**ulti-**E**nvironment **T**rials) provides an
integrated pipeline for crop predictive breeding. In particular,
`learnMET` (1) facilitate environmental characterization via the
retrieval and aggregation of daily weather data; (2) allows the
evaluation of various types of state-of-the-art machine learning
approaches based on relevant cross-validation schemes for
multi-environment trial datasets (3) enables to implement predictions
for unobserved configurations of genotypic and environmental predictors
that the user wants to test *in silico*.
